<p>In this scratch game, I worked with Vincent to make a decision-based game using superheroes. The purpose of this game is to allow the player to decide their fate while having an interactive element in the game. Our game was not a success to the players' interest due to dullness, but I will definitely make it better next time. After this big project, I had grown as a programer and understand more about how codes work. In my future projects, I want to put more effort into my work and achieve beyond from what is expected.</p>

<p>In this project with Deo, I learned a new platform called App Inventor and learn how to make a phone application. App Inventor is similar to Scratch, however it was my least favor because I was not quite familar to the platform. Anyway, in this project, we create and app to help young children identify animals and food. We wanted our users to find interest in learning and practice reading. The way we went with this project was terrible because we kept repeating the same coding and it was boring. However, I am somewhat experience at making apps for the phone now. In my future projects, I do not want to make a program that is repeative in coding unless it is complex.</p>

<p>In this Python project, I worked with Sean Boshkovich on an Periodic Table Quiz. The quiz consisted of 3 different types of quiz such as quizzing on atomic number, name, and symbol of a random element. The element list was very limited but it provided elements with different levels of difficulty. This project had the most errors to occur when coding because we were using so many different codes like the while loop. However, this python project taught me so much out of all my projects. Once again, in my future projects, I want to take on challenges because I will learn new things from them. </p>
