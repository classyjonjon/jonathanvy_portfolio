<p>In this scratch game, I worked with Vincent to make a decision-based game using superheroes. The purpose of this game is to allow the player to decide their fate while having an interactive element in the game. Our game was not a success to the players' interest due to dullness, but I will definitely make it better next time. After this big project, I had grown as a programer and understand more about how codes work. In my future projects, I want to put more effort into my work and achieve beyond from what is expected.</p>
